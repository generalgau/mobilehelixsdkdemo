==================

Demo app for Mobile Helix SDK (see github.com/shallem/LinkHTML5SDK.git for the SDK)

The Mobile Helix SDK enables writing off-line first HTML5 apps, and is awesome. Please get the full SDK here: https://github.com/shallem/LinkHTML5SDK.git

The SDK documentation is a good overview of the full capabilities of the SDK. This repository is a small demo application - a chat client - which will help you get started. Use it as a refernce to add off-line storage, sort, filter, search, and applicable UI elements to your JQM (JQuery Mobile) application.

I'll be working on improving the documentation further. For now, please refer to my slides (as presented at Jquery Con 2014 in Chicago) for a reference of the key functionality provided by the SDK.

High Level Overview of this repo:

This is an HTML5 chat client, meant to demonstrate the offline capabilities provided by the Mobile Helix SDK. The chat client is by no means a fully functional chat client, but feel free to help me make it better.

The server is currently hosted by Openshift, written in PHP using CakePHP with a MySQL back end. To use the chat client as-is please contact @html5appman or email ilya@mobilehelix.com to get credentials to use the server-side component. 

This is a work in progress - please submit your thoughts, requests, improvements, or ask to join in!
